# Seasoners Starter 🌍

This is the official **Seasoners v1** test build — a Next.js + Tailwind site with Magic Link & Google OAuth authentication, Prisma ORM, and more.

### 🚀 Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

```


4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 🔐 Authentication

The application uses NextAuth.js for authentication with two providers:
- Email Magic Links (passwordless)
- Google OAuth

Users can sign in using either method and their session will be persisted across visits.
